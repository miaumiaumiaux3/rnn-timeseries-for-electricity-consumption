# RNN timeseries for electricity consumption

Going through Chollet 2021 chapter 10, but with a different dataset entirely and modifications to the code (for example I used pandas to impute data for the missing '?' values), as well as trying some stuff out at the end for funsies because I wanna get into Pytorch too

Anyways, so the dataset is in a file that I named "household_power_consumption.txt" that's too big for github, causing a whole bunch of fun errors as I tried to upload this code, but if you want that it's here on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/electric-power-consumption-data-set
